# LoanPulse: Automobile Loan Prediction System

## 📊 Project Overview

LoanPulse is an intelligent software solution designed to predict automobile loan default probabilities using advanced deep learning techniques. Developed as part of our 4th Year 1st Semester Deep Learning module, this system helps financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions to minimize risks and optimize their loan approval processes.

## 💡 Solution

LoanPulse leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to:

- Predict loan default probabilities with high accuracy
- Assist NBFIs in making informed loan approval/rejection decisions
- Reduce financial losses associated with loan defaults
- Suggest loan extensions when clients show potential repayment capability
- Provide risk assessment for automobile loan applications
